# 🤖 4-DOF MeArm Robotic Arm

This project showcases a **4-DOF robotic arm** built using the **MeArm kit**, designed to perform **pick-and-place operations**.  
The system integrates **Arduino Uno, PCA9685 PWM driver, SG90 servo motors**, and a **DC-DC buck converter** for safe power management.  
Additionally, **MATLAB** was used for kinematic modeling, trajectory simulation, and workspace analysis, while **Proteus** was used for circuit simulation.
